# Text Analysis Using Python

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze textual data has become an indispensable skill for researchers across various academic fields, including the social and health sciences as well digital humanities.

This intensive two-day workshop is designed specifically for PhD students, academics, and professional researchers, providing them with the skills and techniques needed to perform sophisticated text analysis. As the research landscape increasingly emphasizes computational methods, mastering a programming language like Python can dramatically enhance research capabilities. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in both lectures and practical sessions, ensuring you will leave with not only theoretical understanding but also hands-on experience in applying text analysis techniques to real-world data.
